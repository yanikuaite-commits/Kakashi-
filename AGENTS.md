# KAKASHI BOT AGENT GUIDE

This file is the single source of truth for agents and contributors who need fast, reliable project context.

Use it as the primary documentation for:

- architecture and runtime flow
- command authoring rules
- configuration and persistence rules
- service boundaries
- supported hosting context
- AI-agent operating rules and local skills

For installation walkthroughs and end-user tutorials, see `README.md`.

## PROJECT_OVERVIEW

**Kakashi Bot** is a modular WhatsApp bot framework built on the Baileys ecosystem.

Core principles:

- file-oriented command architecture instead of giant switch/case handlers
- clear separation of permissions by folder
- simple JSON persistence
- reusable services and middleware
- code optimized for readability and maintenance

Permission model:

- `src/commands/owner` → bot owner features
- `src/commands/admin` → group administration features
- `src/commands/member` → features available to regular members

The project philosophy is simple: code for humans first.

## ARCHITECTURE

Main runtime flow:

1. `index.js` or `src/index.js` boots the bot.
2. `src/connection.js` opens the WhatsApp connection, loads auth state, handles pairing, and reconnects when needed.
3. `src/loader.js` registers listeners and wraps event execution with safe error handling.
4. `src/middlewares/onMesssagesUpsert.js` receives messages, filters stale events, handles muted users and participant events, and injects common functions.
5. `src/utils/dynamicCommand.js` validates prefix, permission, group state, and dispatches the selected command.
6. `src/services/*` and `src/utils/*` provide integrations, media processing, database access, and helpers.

High-value architectural notes:

- the bot stores its WhatsApp auth state in `assets/auth/baileys/`
- TIMEOUT_IN_MILLISECONDS_BY_EVENT throttles event handling to reduce spam-ban risk
- `badMacHandler` is part of the self-healing strategy for session issues
- `loadCommonFunctions.js` is the main injection layer for command helpers

## CORE_FILES

| Path | Responsibility |

## COMMAND_GUIDE

Command template:

```javascript
import { PREFIX } from "../../config.js";
import { InvalidParameterError } from "../../errors/index.js";

export default {
  name: "command",
  description: "What it does",
  commands: ["alias1", "alias2"],
  usage: `${PREFIX}command <args>`,
  handle: async ({ sendReply, args }) => {
    if (!args[0]) throw new InvalidParameterError("Missing arguments!");
    await sendReply("Success!");
  },
};
```

Command authoring rules:

- always use injected helpers from `handle()` before introducing new low-level logic
- never manually enforce owner/admin/member permission inside the command if folder placement already defines it
- use `src/errors/` custom errors for automatic user-facing responses
- keep commands focused and readable
- prefer existing helpers and services over duplicating code
- if a command needs persistence, go through `src/utils/database.js`

## TYPING_AND_MIDDLEWARE

Typing lives in `src/@types/index.d.ts`.

Important interfaces:

- `CommandHandleProps`
- `CustomMiddlewareProps`

Useful `handle()` capabilities:

- media flags: `isImage`, `isVideo`, `isAudio`, `isSticker`
- send helpers: `sendReply()`, `sendSuccessReply()`, `sendReact()`, `sendImageFromURL()`, `sendStickerFromFile()`
- download helpers: `downloadImage()`, `downloadVideo()`, `downloadAudio()`, `downloadSticker()`
- context values: `args`, `fullArgs`, `fullMessage`, `remoteJid`, `replyText`, `userLid`

Custom global logic should go into `src/middlewares/customMiddleware.js`.

Use it for:

- custom logs
- extra validations
- automatic reactions
- per-group behavior
- custom participant hooks

Do not modify core middleware flow unless there is a real architectural need.

## DATA_RULES

The bot uses JSON files in `database/` for persistence.

Important files:

| File | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `config.json` | runtime values such as tokens and mutable settings |
| `prefix-groups.json` | custom prefixes per group |
| `auto-responder.json` | trigger/answer entries |
| `muted.json` | muted users by group |
| `inactive-groups.json` | groups where the bot is disabled |
| `group-restrictions.json` | restrictions by message type |

Mandatory rule:

- **never** read these files directly with `fs.readFileSync` inside commands
- always use `src/utils/database.js`

This keeps persistence behavior consistent and avoids duplicated parsing logic.

## ANTI_PAYMENT

Two entry points punish a payment message:

- direct: the bot reads a payment message live in the group (`messageHandler`)
- quoted: a member replies to a payment message, and the ORIGINAL author is
  removed, never the one who quoted (`handleQuotedPaymentRestriction`)

The quoted path is forgeable — `contextInfo.participant` and `quotedMessage` come
from the client — so it is gated by `src/utils/messageEnvelopeRegistry.js`, an
in-memory record of every group message envelope the bot received.

Deliberate rule: **only a message the bot actually read as a payment corroborates
a quote.** A message whose content was never decrypted does NOT corroborate.

| Recorded state | Quote outcome |
| --- | --- |
| `payment` (bot read a payment) | corroborated → punishes |
| `other` (readable, not payment) | contradicted → never punishes |
| `unreadable` (never decrypted) | not corroborated → never punishes |
| not recorded at all | not corroborated → never punishes |

An undecryptable message is indistinguishable from an ordinary message lost to a
Signal session failure, so it is never treated as evidence: acting on it removes
innocent members. The failure mode is always conservative — when in doubt, do not
punish. Do not punish based on undecryptable messages without a new signal that
actually proves payment content.

## SERVICES

### Spider X API

`src/services/spider-x-api.js` powers:

- downloads from TikTok, YouTube, Instagram, Facebook, Pinterest
- AI endpoints such as Gemini, GPT-5 Mini, Flux
- sticker endpoints such as `attp`, `ttp`, and `brat`
- utility endpoints used by several commands

It depends on `SPIDER_API_TOKEN`, which can come from:

- `src/config.js`
- runtime database config through `/set-spider-api-token`

### Media Services

`src/services/ffmpeg.js` handles media conversion, including audio normalization and voice-note friendly formats.

`src/services/sticker.js` handles:

- static sticker processing
- animated sticker workflows
- EXIF metadata
- WebP packaging

## STACK

Runtime and dependency snapshot is in the root `package.json`

Project-level scripts:

- `npm start`
- `npm test`
- `npm run test:all`
- `npm run patch:baileys`

## BAILEYS_PATCHES

`node_modules/baileys` and `node_modules/libsignal` are intentionally committed to git
(see the negated entries in `.gitignore`), because the project ships local changes to
the baileys build output.

Patched files, all marked with `// Alterado por: Dev Gui` on the first line:

| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `lib/Socket/messages-send.js` | Adds the `biz` / `native_flow` binary nodes and normalizes `listMessage.listType`, without which WhatsApp silently drops buttons and lists. |
| `lib/Utils/messages.js` | Builds `interactiveMessage` from `buttons`, `interactiveButtons`, `cards` and `sections`, plus the legacy `buttonsMessage` / `listMessage` fallbacks. |
| `lib/Types/Message.d.ts` | Type declarations for the options above. Types only, no runtime effect. |

The single source of truth is `scripts/patch-baileys.mjs`. It contains the Baileys
compatibility edits directly, following the same self-contained pattern used by
Spider Bot X. The script applies transformations anchored to code snippets instead of
line numbers and uses sentinels to keep repeated runs idempotent.

The script runs on `postinstall`, so every `npm install` / `npm ci` reapplies the
edits. It is pure JavaScript and does not depend on the `patch` binary, which is absent
on Termux and slim Docker images. A missing anchor or required snippet throws an error
and stops the postinstall instead of leaving a partially compatible Baileys unnoticed.

Rules:

- never edit `node_modules/baileys` directly without also updating
  `scripts/patch-baileys.mjs`
- when bumping Baileys, run `npm install` and read the postinstall output; a failure
  means upstream changed one of the anchored snippets
- to fix an upstream change, update the anchor or replacement in the single script and
  rerun `npm run patch:baileys`

## HOSTING_AND_PTERODACTYL

The project README currently highlights the supported hosts in its installation section.
Treat `README.md` as the source of truth for host names and links.

Installation tutorials stay in `README.md`.

If the topic is about hosting, VPS setup, startup configuration, schedules, SFTP, Pterodactyl panel usage, or backup flow, agents should also load:

- `.agents/skills/pterodactyl-specialist/SKILL.md`

That skill is the specialized source for Pterodactyl guidance.

## STABILITY_AND_ERRORS

Stability mechanisms:

- `DEVELOPER_MODE` in `src/config.js` increases logging
- runtime logs are stored in `assets/temp/wa-logs.txt`
- `src/utils/badMacHandler.js` helps recover from repeated session failures
- TIMEOUT_IN_MILLISECONDS_BY_EVENT throttles event execution

Use these custom error classes:

- `InvalidParameterError`
- `WarningError`
- `DangerError`

These are expected by the bot flow and produce cleaner automatic replies.

## AGENT_RULES

Agents working in this repository should follow these rules:

- prefer `AGENTS.md` as the primary project context source
- use `README.md` for installation and end-user tutorials
- treat the repository as modular and file-oriented
- avoid manual JSON reads from `database/` in command code
- prefer existing helpers and services before adding new primitives
- never modify `assets/auth/` manually
- when supporting users, stay read-only unless explicitly asked to change code
- when support needs extra context, load only the relevant sections or files
- never expose the values of `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `LINKER_API_KEY`, or `SPIDER_API_TOKEN`

## SKILLS

This repository uses a local skills pattern to help AI agents load specialized context only when needed.

Current local skill directory:

- `.agents/skills/*`

Current local skill:

- `pterodactyl-specialist` → focused instructions for Pterodactyl panel usage, hosting workflows, files, databases, backups, schedules, bots, and APIs

Skill usage rule:

- if the topic is about hosting or **Pterodactyl**, load `.agents/skills/pterodactyl-specialist/SKILL.md`

This keeps support and agent workflows selective instead of forcing every answer to carry all hosting knowledge by default.

## DOESN'T RUNS

Do not run `npm test` or `npm start` in this repository.
